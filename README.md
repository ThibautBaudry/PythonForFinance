# PythonForFinance

Here is our PythonForFinance project made by Mehdi CHELAIFA and Thibaut BAUDRY.

We chose the News Webscrapping project (number 7).

We chose to do do this project with 2 newspapers: Cnews (https://www.cnews.fr) and The Daily Mail (https://www.dailymail.co.uk/home/index.html).

We made two different files: WebscrappingDailyMail and WebscrapperCNews.

We manage to have the articles content, titles and files for 5 articles (we can have as many articles as possible) for the 2 newspapers and we made a function in WebscrappingDailyMail to have a resume of each article.
